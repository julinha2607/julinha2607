My name is Julia, I'm a Junior Software developer. I just finished a nearly two year internship at a multinational working as a Development Intern, serving both as a Front End Developer and as a Game Developer. I was recently called back to work at the same company as a Front End Developer, but working towards becoming a Fullstack Software Developer. 
I hold a degree in Systems Development & Analysis and I'm also really interested in DevOps and Software Architecture, so in here you're gonna see some of that. 

Stroll aroung and have some fun!
